# The address can either be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a hexadecimal
# IPv6 address. It can also be a hostname such as localhost. If a IPv6 address
# is given or the hostname gets resolved to a IPv6 address then the dual-stack
# option controls if dual-stack mode gets enabled (on) or disabled (off) on the
# socket bound to that address.
#
# 0.0.0.0, 4223 and off are the default values.

# Log level per category
#
# The log output is divided into different categories. The visibility of log
# messages can be controlled individually for each category.
#
# Valid values are error, warn, info and debug. The default value is info. It
# means that log messages on error, warn and info level are shown, but messages
# on debug level are ignored. This can be overridden with the --debug command
# line option.

log_level.usb = info
log_level.network = info
log_level.hotplug = info
log_level.hardware = info
